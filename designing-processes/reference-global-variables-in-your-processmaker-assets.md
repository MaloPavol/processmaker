# Reference Magic Variables in ProcessMaker Assets

## Overview

ProcessMaker uses a set of Magic Variables that you may reference in ProcessMaker Query Language \([PMQL](../using-processmaker/search-processmaker-data-using-pmql/what-is-pmql.md)\) queries and in your ProcessMaker assets, such as ProcessMaker [Scripts](scripts/what-is-a-script.md) and [Screens](design-forms/what-is-a-form.md).

ProcessMaker uses a schema-less JSON data model from which to read, write, and store Request data. Since the JSON data model is schema-less \(meaning that it does not require a specific schema or structure from which ProcessMaker assets must conform\), the JSON data model is structured from the JSON objects in ProcessMaker assets used in a Request: the **Variable Name** setting values in a ProcessMaker Screen or Request variables a ProcessMaker Script creates. When an in-progress Request routes through the Process, Request data aggregates into the JSON data model, thereby becoming Request data.

However, ProcessMaker uses a set of Magic Variables that become part of the JSON data model for all Requests. ProcessMaker uses these Magic Variables to store ProcessMaker user, Process, and Request related data for all Requests. During an in-progress Request, these ProcessMaker Magic Variables are updated. All ProcessMaker Magic Variables are preceded by an underscore \(`_`\) character in the JSON data model.

ProcessMaker [users](../processmaker-administration/add-users/what-is-a-user.md) that have the [Requests: Edit Request Data](../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#requests) permission may view the JSON data model for a completed Request. This JSON data model displays from the [**Data** tab in a completed Request's summary](../using-processmaker/requests/request-details/summary-for-completed-requests.md#editable-request-data). Below is an example.

## How to Use Magic Variables

Use ProcessMaker Magic Variables in a variety of ways in ProcessMaker and in ProcessMaker assets.

### Reference in PMQL Queries for Request and Task Searches

Reference ProcessMaker Magic Variables to compose ProcessMaker Query Language \([PMQL](../using-processmaker/search-processmaker-data-using-pmql/what-is-pmql.md)\) advanced queries for [Request searches](../using-processmaker/requests/search-for-a-request.md#advanced-search-for-a-request) and [Task searches](../using-processmaker/task-management/search-for-a-task.md#advanced-search-for-a-task). See the following topics:

* [`Request` Data Type PMQL Properties](../using-processmaker/search-processmaker-data-using-pmql/pmql-properties-by-data-type/pmql-properties-for-the-request-data-type.md)
* [`Task` Data Type PMQL Properties](../using-processmaker/search-processmaker-data-using-pmql/pmql-properties-by-data-type/task-data-type-pmql-properties.md)

### Mock in Script Testing

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to edit a [ProcessMaker Script](scripts/what-is-a-script.md) unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Scripts: Edit Scripts
* Scripts: View Scripts

See the ProcessMaker [Scripts](../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#scripts) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

[Mock ProcessMaker Magic Variable values while mocking Request data](scripts/script-editor.md#mock-request-data-coming-into-the-processmaker-script) during testing to ensure your ProcessMaker Script runs as you intended.

### Reference in Screens

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to edit a ProcessMaker Screen control unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Screens: Edit Screens
* Screens: View Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Reference ProcessMaker Magic Variables in ProcessMaker Screens in the following ways:

* \*\*\*\*[**Rich Text controls**](design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/rich-text-control-settings.md)**:** Reference a ProcessMaker Magic Variable's value in a Rich Text control through the **Rich Text Content** setting.
* \*\*\*\*[**Computed Properties**](design-forms/screens-builder/manage-computed-properties/)**:** [Reference a ProcessMaker Magic Variable's value from a computed Property](design-forms/screens-builder/manage-computed-properties/#add-a-computed-property). Use JavaScript to return a ProcessMaker Magic Variable's value, then store it in a computed Property.

## Example of All Magic Variables

Below is an example that contains all ProcessMaker Magic Variables. Each contains a value as it might be read from the [**Data** tab in a completed Request summary](../using-processmaker/requests/request-details/summary-for-completed-requests.md#editable-request-data). This example indicates the JSON structure for each ProcessMaker Magic Variable.

## Magic Variable Descriptions

Below are descriptions of each ProcessMaker Magic Variable. Since these descriptions are outlined in tabular format, they do not imply how they are structured in the JSON data model. Refer to the example in the [Example of All Magic Variables](reference-global-variables-in-your-processmaker-assets.md#example-of-all-global-variables) section to see how each JSON object is structured in the overall JSON data model.

### `_user` Magic Variable
