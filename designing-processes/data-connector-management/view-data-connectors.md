The [Data Connector](what-is-a-data-connector.md) package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Data Connectors package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permission Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Data Connectors: View Data Connectors" permission to view the list of ProcessMaker Data Connectors unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected.

See the ProcessMaker [Data Connectors](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#data-connectors) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
