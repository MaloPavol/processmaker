# View Active Processes

## View All Active Processes

ProcessMaker displays all active [Processes](../what-is-a-process.md) in one table that Process Owners have created throughout your organization. This makes it easy to manage active Processes. An active Process is one in which has not been [archived](remove-a-process.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
### Permission Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Processes: View Processes" permission to view the list of Processes unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected.

See the ProcessMaker [Processes](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#processes) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.

### Looking for Inactive Processes?

Click the **Archived Processes** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/archived-processes-icon-processes.png)to view inactive Processes. [Archived Processes](remove-a-process.md) are by definition inactive.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to view all active Processes in your organization:

1. Ensure that you are [logged on](../../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Designer** option from the top menu. The **Processes** tab displays all active Processes in the **Processes** page.

{% hint style="info" %}
Click the **Processes** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/processses-icon-processes.png)from the left sidebar to view the **Processes** tab when you are viewing other Process-related pages.
{% endhint %}

![&quot;Processes&quot; tab displays all Processes in your organization](../../../.gitbook/assets/processes.png)

The **Processes** tab displays the following information in tabular format about active Processes:

* **Name:** The **Name** column displays the Process name. If the Process is not valid whereby it cannot successfully run Requests through completion, the following icon displays after the process name:![](../../../.gitbook/assets/invalid-process-icon-process-modeler.png).
* **Category:** The **Category** column displays in which [Process Category](manage-process-categories/what-is-a-process-category.md) the Process is assigned.
* **Owner:** The **Owner** column displays the Process Owner who maintains the Process. Hover your cursor over a user's avatar to view that person's full name.
* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the Process was last modified. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the Process was created. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.

### Edit a Process

Click the **Open Modeler** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/edit-icon.png). See [Model Your Process](../../process-design/model-your-process/) for topics.

### Configure a Process

Click the **Configure** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/configure-process-icon-processes-page-processes.png). See [Edit Process Configuration](edit-the-name-description-category-or-status-of-a-process.md#edit-configuration-information-about-a-process).

### Export a Process

### Pause or Resume All Start Timer Events in a Process

Click the **Pause Start Timer Events** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pause-start-timer-event-element-icon-processes.png)to stop the schedule for new Requests by pausing all [Start Timer Event](../../process-design/model-your-process/process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#start-timer-event) elements in the Process. Note that this icon only displays if that Process uses at least one Start Timer Event that is not paused.

Click the **Play Start Timer Events** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/play-start-timer-event-element-icon-processes.png)to resume the schedule for new Requests by resuming all Start Timer Event elements in the Process.

### No Processes?
