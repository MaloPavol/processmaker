## Edit a ProcessMaker Vocabulary

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Vocabularies package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/vocabularies.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The [Vocabularies](../what-is-a-vocabulary.md) package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Vocabularies [package](../../../package-development-distribution/first-topic.md) can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to edit a ProcessMaker Vocabulary unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Vocabularies: Edit Vocabularies
* Vocabularies: View Vocabularies

See the ProcessMaker [Vocabularies](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#vocabularies) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.

### Learn How to Design JSON Schemas

Need to learn how to design JSON schemas? Start with [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/). Need to learn how to convert valid JSON to a JSON schema? Use the [JSON Schema Tool](https://jsonschema.net), though do not use JSON intended for production on this free GitHub application.

3. Edit the following information about the ProcessMaker Vocabulary as necessary:
   * In the **Title** field, edit the ProcessMaker Vocabulary name. This is a required field.
