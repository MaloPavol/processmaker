# Record List Control Settings

## Control Description <a id="control-description"></a>

The Record List control functions differently in [Form](../types-for-screens.md#form)- and [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker [Screens](../../what-is-a-form.md):

* [Form-Type Screen Usage](record-list-control-settings.md#form-type-screen-usage)
* [Display-Type Screen Usage](record-list-control-settings.md#display-type-screen-usage)

{% hint style="info" %}
This control is available for the following Screen types:

* [Form](../types-for-screens.md#form) type
* [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display) type
* [Email](../types-for-screens.md#email) type \(requires the [Send Email package](../../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/email.md)\)

See [Screen Types](../types-for-screens.md).
{% endhint %}

### Form-Type Screen Usage

#### Configuration Description

In the [Form](../types-for-screens.md#form)-type ProcessMaker Screen, the Record List control records a record list. The record list is composed of multiple records, of which the [Request](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) participant enters data components for each record. The controls used to record each record's data components are designed in a second page of the same ProcessMaker Screen containing the Record List control. The page that records the data components of each record cannot be on the same page as the Record List control.

When configuring the Record List control, specify how the record list displays information after the control has recorded each record for the list:

* **Column Headers:** Specify each column header that represents the data components for each record. For example, label a column header `First Name` to indicate that this data component displays each person's first name for each record in the list.
* **Values:** For each specified column header, reference the **Variable Name** setting value for the control on the second page that receives a data component for each record corresponding with each column header. For example, use a [Line Input](line-input-control-settings.md) control with a **Variable Name** setting value of `LineInputFirstName` to receive each person's first name for each record in the list, and then associate that `LineInputFirstName` value with the `First Name` column.

After configuring the columns for the record list, sort the order in which they are to display in the record list.

Alternatively, use JSON format to configure the columns and their corresponding **Variable Name** setting values in their respective order to display in the Record List control.

Optionally, values can be edited after the Request participant initially enters the record\(s\) in the record list. However, after the Request participant submits the Screen, the record list cannot be changed.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [Form-Type Screen Settings](record-list-control-settings.md#form-type-screen-settings).
{% endhint %}

#### Experience Description

Expect a similar experience as a Request participant when using a properly configured Record List control during a Request as follows:

1. Open the [Task](../../../../using-processmaker/task-management/what-is-a-task.md) with the ProcessMaker Screen using the Record List control. The Record List control displays an empty record list. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/record-list-control-preview-01-screens-builder-processes.png) 
2. Click the **Add Record** button to add a record to the record list. A screen displays to enter data components for one record. In doing so, the Record List control references the controls on the secondary page of the Screen. In this example, enter a record for registrars for a conference. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/record-list-control-preview-02-screens-builder-processes.png) 
3. Enter information for each data component for the record.
4. Click the **OK** button and ignore the Submit control.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 for each record in the record list. As you enter each record, it displays in the record list. If the Record List control is configured to be editable \(as shown below\), then the **Edit** button![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/edit-record-record-list-control-screens-builder-processes.png)and **Delete** button![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/delete-record-record-list-control-screens-builder-processes.png)display to edit or delete a record, respectively. Otherwise, these buttons do not display and records cannot be changed after they are added. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/record-list-control-preview-03-screens-builder-processes.png) 
6. Submit the Screen to save the record list in the Request. After the Task is submitted, the record list cannot be changed.

### Display-Type Screen Usage

#### Configuration Description

In the [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker Screen, the Record List control displays a record list previously entered into a [Form](../types-for-screens.md#form)-type Screen in a previous Task of that [Request](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md).

When configuring the Record List control, specify how the record list displays information in the Display-type ProcessMaker Screen:

* **Column Headers:** Specify each column header that represents the data components for each record in the list. For example, if the record list had recorded first names, then label a column header `First Name`.
* **Values:** For each specified column header, reference the **Variable Name** setting value for the control that corresponds with that specified column header's record data component. To do so, open the ProcessMaker Screen that contains the Record List control that recorded the list, then locate the control that corresponds with the specified column header's record data component. For example, if a [Line Input](line-input-control-settings.md) control with a **Variable Name** setting value of `LineInputFirstName` is used to record each person's first name for each record in the list, associate that `LineInputFirstName` with the specified `First Name` column header.
* Repeat this procedure for each column header and its corresponding control that received a record data component for the record list. Make note of each control's **Variable Name** setting value, as you must provide this same value when configuring each column header in the record list.

After configuring the column headers for the record list, sort the order in which they are to display in the record list.

Alternatively, use JSON format to configure the column headers and their corresponding **Variable Name** setting values in their respective order to display in the Record List control.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [Display-type Screen Settings](record-list-control-settings.md#display-type-screen-settings).
{% endhint %}

#### Experience Description

After opening a Task or Manual Task with a Display-type ProcessMaker Screen using a Record List control, the record list displays each record as entered in a Form-type Screen in a previous Task of that Request.

## Use the `_parent` JSON Key to Reference Request Data from Controls in a Record List Control

The Record List control uses a unique JSON key available to any control placed into the secondary page from which the Record List control references its values so that those controls can reference Request data. Controls that are placed into that secondary page function within a container and may only access another control's data that is in the same secondary page. Use the `_parent` JSON key in a control's settings placed into the secondary page to reference Request data outside of that Record List control.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `_parent` JSON key only applies to controls placed into a Record List control or [Loop](loop-control-settings.md) control.
{% endhint %}

Consider the following examples:

* A Line Input control placed into the secondary page requires a default value to display from another Line Input control used during that Request of which its **Variable Name** setting is `Line_Input_Data`.  From the Line Input control placed into the secondary page, enter the following into the [**Default Value** setting](line-input-control-settings.md#default-value): `{{ _parent.Line_Input_Data }}`.
* A Select List control placed within the secondary page requires its options to display from another Select List control's options used during that Request of which its **Variable Name** setting is `Select_List_Options`. While configuring the Select List control placed into the secondary page to [use Request data as its data source](select-list-control-settings.md#reference-request-data), enter the following into the **Options Variable** setting: `{{ _parent.Select_List_Options }}`.

## Add the Control to a ProcessMaker Screen <a id="add-the-control-to-a-processmaker-screen"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to add a control to a ProcessMaker Screen unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Screens: Edit Screens
* Screens: View Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add this control to the [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md):

1. [Create a new ProcessMaker Screen](../../manage-forms/create-a-new-form.md) or click the **Edit** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/edit-icon.png)to edit the selected Screen. The ProcessMaker Screen is in [Design mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#editor-mode).
2. View the ProcessMaker Screen page to which to add the control.
3. Locate the **Record List** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/record-list-control-screens-builder-processes.png)in the panel to the left of the Screen Builder canvas.
4. Drag the **Record List** icon into the Screen Builder canvas. Existing controls on the Screen Builder canvas adjust positioning based on where you drag the control.
5. Place into the Screen Builder canvas where you want the control to display on the ProcessMaker Screen.

   ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/record-list-control-placed-screens-builder-processes.png)

6. Do one of the following depending on whether you are using the Record List control on a [Form](../types-for-screens.md#form)- or [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker Screen:

   **Form-type ProcessMaker Screen:**

   1. Create a new page in this ProcessMaker Screen. Use this page to design how the Request participant enters data that the Record List control records. The page that records the submitted records cannot be on the same page as the Record List control. See [Add a New Page to a ProcessMaker Screen](../add-a-new-page-to-a-screen.md#add-a-new-page-to-a-processmaker-screen).
   2. On the new page, design the form using controls from which the Request participant enters the data component that the Record List control receives for each record. In each of the controls that receive a data component for each record, make note of the **Variable Name** setting values for each control; these values correspond with how the Record List control displays the record list in the **Value** parameter for each column. Do not place a [Submit Button](submit-button-control-settings.md#control-description) control on the new page; otherwise, the [Task](../../../../using-processmaker/task-management/what-is-a-task.md) cannot be submitted during a Request.
   3. Configure each of the controls placed on the new page. If a control placed into this page requires to use Request data, use the `parent` JSON key. See [Use the `parent` JSON Key to Reference Request Data from Controls in a Loop Control](record-list-control-settings.md#use-the-parent-json-key-to-reference-request-data-from-controls-in-a-record-list-control).
   4. Return to the page that the Record List control is placed, and then configure the Record List control. See [Settings](record-list-control-settings.md#inspector-settings). Ensure to add a Submit Button or [Page Navigation](page-navigation-button-control-settings.md#control-description) control on the page containing the Record List control so that the Task can be submitted after all records have been added to the record list during a Request.

   **Display-type ProcessMaker Screen:**

   1. Configure the Record List control. See [Settings](record-list-control-settings.md#inspector-settings).

7. Validate that the control is configured correctly. See [Validate Your Screen](../validate-your-screen.md#validate-a-processmaker-screen).

## Move the Control on the Page

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to move a control in a ProcessMaker Screen page unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Screens: Edit Screens
* Screens: View Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

After [adding a control to a ProcessMaker Screen page](record-list-control-settings.md#add-the-control-to-a-processmaker-screen), you may move it to another location on that page such that it is above or below other controls placed on that page. Consider when moving this control that it contains the set of records during in-progress [Requests](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md). A control cannot be moved to another [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md) page.

Follow these steps to move a control to another location on that ProcessMaker Screen page:

1. Place your cursor anywhere on the control not displaying the **Duplicate Control**![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/copy-duplicate-control-icon-screen-builder-processes.png)or **Delete Control**![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/delete-screen-control-screens-builder-processes.png)buttons.
2. Hold your cursor, then drag the control above or below other controls on that ProcessMaker Screen page. Screen Builder previews where the control would display on the page based on how you position the control above or below other controls. If the control cannot be placed in a location because your cursor is above an existing control or too far to the left or right of the page, the![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/movement-not-allowed-icon-screen-builder-processes.png)icon displays in the preview.
3. Place the control at the location on the page you want it. The other control\(s\) on the page automatically adjust position.

## Copy the Control with its Settings

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to copy a control in a ProcessMaker Screen unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Screens: Edit Screens
* Screens: View Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Copying a control also copies the current settings of that control. The copied control displays below other controls placed on that [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md) page.

{% hint style="info" %}
As a best practice, after copying a control, change the [**Variable Name** setting](record-list-control-settings.md#variable-name) value for the copied control to its own unique variable value. Otherwise, in-progress [Requests](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) that use this ProcessMaker Screen read from and send data to both controls.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to copy a control:

1. Select the control to be copied.
2. Click the **Duplicate Control** button![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/copy-duplicate-control-icon-screen-builder-processes.png). The control copies with its current settings, and then displays below other controls placed on that page.

## Delete the Control from a ProcessMaker Screen

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to delete a control from a ProcessMaker Screen unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Screens: Edit Screens
* Screens: View Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a control also deletes configuration for that control. If you add another control, it will have default settings.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to delete a control from a [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md) page:

1. Select the control to be deleted.
2. Click the **Delete** button![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/delete-screen-control-screens-builder-processes.png). The control deletes. Other controls on that ProcessMaker Screen page adjust their locations automatically.

## Example

Consider the following example how to use a Record List control in a [Form](../types-for-screens.md#form)-type ProcessMaker Screen. Configure a Record List control to record the following data components about registrars for a conference. The table below shows how the Record List control displays the record list. Configuring each column and the **Variable Name** setting value for each control that records the data component that displays in that column is the same for both Form- and [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker Screens.

On a second page in the same ProcessMaker [Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md), use Screen controls for [Request](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) participants to enter data components for each record. Ensure the following:

* The Record List control references the specified controls on the second page. The controls that receive the record data components cannot be on the same page as the Record List control. 
* In each of the controls that receives a data component for each record, make note of the **Variable Name** setting values for each control; these values correspond with how the Record List control displays the record list in the **Value** parameter for each column. This setting is in the **Columns** panel. See [Settings](record-list-control-settings.md#inspector-settings).

The following table outlines how to configure the **Column Header** and **Value** settings for each column in the Record List control for this example.

| Control Type | Control's "Variable Name" Value | Record List "Column Header" Value | Record List "Value" Value | What It Represents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Line Input | firstname | First Name | firstname | Registrar's first name |
| Line Input | lastname | Last Name | lastname | Registrar's last name |
| Line Input | email | Email Address | email | Registrar's email address |
| Select | confirmation | Confirmation | confirmation | Attendance confirmation |

The following image shows the **Column Header** and **Value** setting values in the Record List control to reference the [Line Input](line-input-control-settings.md) control with the **Variable Name** setting value of `firstname`.

![&quot;Column Header&quot; and &quot;Value&quot; settings to reference a Line Input control](../../../../.gitbook/assets/record-list-control-column-screens-builder-processes.png)

The following image shows the column configuration for the Record List control. See [Settings](record-list-control-settings.md#inspector-settings) for the Record List control setting descriptions.

* [List Label](record-list-control-settings.md#list-label)

#### Variable Name

Edit the default **Variable Name** setting value for this control if necessary. The **Variable Name** setting value represents data in this control during [Requests](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md). Ensure that the **Variable Name** setting value is a unique name from other controls in this [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md) and contains at least one letter. This is a required setting.  
![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/record-list-control-variable-name-screen-builder-processes.png) 

Use the **Variable Name** setting value in the following ways:

* Reference this control by its **Variable Name** setting's value.
* Reference this control's value in a different Screen Builder control. To do so, use mustache syntax and reference this control's **Variable Name** value in the target control. Example: `{{ RecordListControl }}`.
* Reference this value in [**Visibility Rule** setting expressions](expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings.md).

#### List Label

Edit the default label that displays for this control if necessary. **New Record List** is the default value.  
![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/record-list-control-list-label-screen-builder-processes.png) 

### Configuration Panel Settings

Click the control while in [Design](../screens-builder-modes.md#design-mode) mode, and then click the **Advanced** panel that is on the right-side of the Screen Builder canvas.

Below are settings for the Record List control in the **Advanced** panel:

* [Visibility Rule](record-list-control-settings.md#visibility-rule)
* [CSS Selector Name](record-list-control-settings.md#css-selector-name)

#### Visibility Rule

Specify an expression that indicates the condition\(s\) under which this control displays. See [Expression Syntax Components for "Visibility Rule" Control Settings](expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings.md#expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings). If this setting does not have an expression, then this control displays by default.  
![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/visibility-rule-screen-builder-processes.png) 

{% hint style="info" %}
To make this control hidden until another control contains a value, enter the **Variable Name** setting value of that control to this control's **Visibility Rule** setting.
{% endhint %}

#### CSS Selector Name

Enter the value to represent this control in custom CSS syntax when in [Custom CSS](../add-custom-css-to-a-screen.md#add-custom-css-to-a-processmaker-screen) mode. As a best practice, use the same **CSS Selector Name** value on different controls of the same type to apply the same custom CSS style to all those controls.

* \*\*\*\*[**Configuration** panel](record-list-control-settings.md#configuration-panel-settings-1)
* \*\*\*\*[**Columns** panel](record-list-control-settings.md#columns-panel-settings-1)
* \*\*\*\*[**Design** panel](record-list-control-settings.md#design-panel-settings-1)
* \*\*\*\*[**Advanced** panel](record-list-control-settings.md#advanced-panel-settings-1)

### Variable Panel Settings

Click the control while in [Design](../screens-builder-modes.md#design-mode) mode, and then click the **Variable** panel that is on the right-side of the Screen Builder canvas.

Below are settings for the Record List control in the **Variable** panel:

* [Variable Name](record-list-control-settings.md#variable-name-1)
* [List Label](record-list-control-settings.md#list-label-1)

#### Variable Name

Edit the default **Variable Name** setting value for this control if necessary. The **Variable Name** setting value represents data in this control during [Requests](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md). Ensure that the **Variable Name** setting value is a unique name from other controls in this [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md) and contains at least one letter. This is a required setting.  
![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/record-list-control-variable-name-screen-builder-processes.png) 

Use the **Variable Name** setting value in the following ways:

* Reference this control by its **Variable Name** setting's value.
* Reference this control's value in a different Screen Builder control. To do so, use mustache syntax and reference this control's **Variable Name** value in the target control. Example: `{{ RecordListControl }}`.
* Reference this value in [**Visibility Rule** setting expressions](expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings.md).

#### List Label

Edit the default label that displays for this control if necessary. **New Record List** is the default value.

### Columns Panel Settings

{% hint style="info" %}
Follow these steps before configuring columns in this Record List control:

1. Save setting configurations in this Record List control if necessary.
2. While in [Design](../screens-builder-modes.md#design-mode) mode, open the ProcessMaker Screen that contains the Record List control that recorded the list.
3. Locate each control that corresponds with each specified column header. Each of these controls received a record data component when the record list was recorded in a Request. Make note of each control's **Variable Name** setting value, as you must provide this same value when configuring each column header in this Record List control.
{% endhint %}

Click the control while in [Design](../screens-builder-modes.md#design-mode) mode, and then click the **Columns** panel that is on the right-side of the Screen Builder canvas.
