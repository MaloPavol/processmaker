# Google Places Control Settings

## Control Description

The Google Places control is a text field the [Request](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) participant uses to start entering an address, location, or business name. The Google Places control uses the Google API to auto-complete that address or location. The Google Place control stores the selected address in the Request data as well as all the returned data from the Google API.

{% hint style="info" %}
This control is only available for [Form](../types-for-screens.md#form)-type ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](../types-for-screens.md).
{% endhint %}

Below are a few ways to use the Google Places control:

* Allow Request participants to easily enter a shipping or billing address. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-control-address-example-package.png) 
* Enter a business name into the Google Places control to select a business location. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-control-business-example-package.png) 
* Enter well-known monuments or international airport names to get their addresses or locations when requesting to travel. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-control-airport-example-package.png) 

## Add the Control to a ProcessMaker Screen

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

To add a Google Places control to a [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md), the [Google Places package](../../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/google-places-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Google Places control and the Google Places [package](../../../../package-development-distribution/first-topic.md) are not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Google Places package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to add a control to a ProcessMaker Screen unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

{% endhint %}

After [adding a control to a ProcessMaker Screen page](google-places-control-settings.md#add-the-control-to-a-processmaker-screen), you may move it to another location on that page such that it is above or below other controls placed on that page. A control cannot be moved to another [ProcessMaker Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md) page.

Follow these steps to move a control to another location on that ProcessMaker Screen page:

1. Place your cursor anywhere on the control not displaying the **Duplicate Control**![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/copy-duplicate-control-icon-screen-builder-processes.png)or **Delete Control**![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/delete-screen-control-screens-builder-processes.png)buttons.
2. Hold your cursor, then drag the control above or below other controls on that ProcessMaker Screen page. Screen Builder previews where the control would display on the page based on how you position the control above or below other controls. If the control cannot be placed in a location because your cursor is above an existing control or too far to the left or right of the page, the![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/movement-not-allowed-icon-screen-builder-processes.png)icon displays in the preview.
3. Place the control at the location on the page you want it. The other control\(s\) on the page automatically adjust position.

#### Example of the Secondary Text for the Selected Address or Location

Below is the Google Places control selection for this example. The Google Places control's **Variable Name** setting value is the default `google_places_1`.

![Google Places control example](../../../../.gitbook/assets/google-places-control-business-example-package.png)

If a [Rich Text](rich-text-control-settings.md) control references this Google Places control's secondary text for the selected address, use the following syntax in the Rich Text control's content using [mustache syntax](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html):

```text
{{ google_places_1.0.predictions.0.description.0.types }}
```

The Rich Text control displays the following during a Request:

```text
"point_of_interest", "establishment"
```
