# Advanced Screen Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Advanced Screen [package](../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Advanced Screen package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Advanced Screen package to design your own advanced forms using HTML syntax and JavaScript. This is an ideal solution for highly technical designers to create their own form designs and functionality.

When the Advanced Screen package is installed in your ProcessMaker instance, create a new ProcessMaker Screen using the [Advanced](../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#advanced) Screen type. Screen Builder displays a template that contains a sample Advanced-type ProcessMaker Screen.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Advanced Screen type is a highly technical solution only for advanced HTML and JavaScript designers intended only for specific solutions. ProcessMaker Support cannot support nor troubleshoot advanced forms.

As a best practice when developing Advanced-type ProcessMaker Screens, design your Screen outside of ProcessMaker to test its functionality, and then copy-and-paste your code into Screen Builder to test your Screen in Requests, Tasks or [ProcessMaker Collections](collections.md). The Advanced Screen type cannot be previewed in Screen Builder.

Please use at your own risk.
{% endhint %}

See the [Advanced](../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#advanced) Screen type for a template from which to begin designing an Advanced ProcessMaker Screen.
