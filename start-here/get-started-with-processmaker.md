## Develop Processes

This section contains videos discussing Process development proof-of-concepts and ideas how to use ProcessMaker.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Analyze Documents using RPAs" %}
### Example 1

See how ProcessMaker integrates with third-party services Amazon Textract and UiPath Robotic Process Automation \(RPA\) so a loan application workflow scans, analyzes, and intelligently routes a [Request](../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) and provision a bot accordingly.

* **Intended audience:** Process designers and business analysts
* **Viewing time:** 11 minutes; contains narration
* **Tags:** [Process](../designing-processes/viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md) design; design Process; workflow design; design workflow; form; web form; design form; form design; analyze documents; Load Application Process Request; API; application program interface; third-party API call; RPA; robotic process automation; banking; financial; loan application; demo; video

{% embed url="https://vimeo.com/383574552" %}

### Example 2

See how ProcessMaker integrates with third-party RPA service Automation Anywhere \(AA\) so a loan application workflow submits a loan request candidate's name to AA to automatically search the Office of Foreign Assets Control \(OFAC\) site to determine if that candidate is sanctioned from financial transactions, receives AA's response, and then intelligently routes a Request accordingly.

* **Intended audience:** Process designers and business analysts
* **Viewing time:** 16 minutes; contains narration
* **Tags:** Process design; design Process; workflow design; design workflow; form; web form; design form; form design; analyze documents; Load Application Process Request; API; application program interface; third-party API call; RPA; robotic process automation; banking; financial; loan application; demo; video

{% tab title="Call Third-Party APIs with Data Connectors" %}
### Example 1

See how [ProcessMaker Data Connectors](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md) call third-party Application Program Interfaces \(APIs\), and then use that data in [Processes](../designing-processes/viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md).

* **Intended audience:** Process designers, business analysts, software developers, coding engineers
* **Viewing time:** 9 minutes; contains narration
* **Tags:** [Process](../designing-processes/viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md) design; design Process; workflow design; design workflow; form; web form; design form; form design; [ProcessMaker Data Connector](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md); API; application program interface; third-party API call; [Screen Builder](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/); [Select List](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/select-list-control-settings.md) control; demo; video

{% embed url="https://vimeo.com/393099655" %}

### Example 2

This example demonstrates dependent fields: how the options in one [Select List](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/select-list-control-settings.md) control depend on which option is selected from a previous Select List control. This example demonstrates how a Select List control in a [ProcessMaker Screen](../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md) can display the names of major universities around the world as its options in a drop-down menu. The options in this Select List control come from a [ProcessMaker Data Connector](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md) that calls a third-party Application Program Interface \(API\) when the ProcessMaker Screen containing the Select List control opens.

* **Intended audience:** Process designers, business analysts, software developers, coding engineers

## Design ProcessMaker Screens

This section contains videos discussing [ProcessMaker Screen](../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md) design using [Screen Builder](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/what-is-screens-builder.md).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Using Screen Builder" %}
See how to design interactive web-based forms, called [ProcessMaker Screens](../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md), using [Screen Builder](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/what-is-screens-builder.md).

* **Intended audience:** Process designers, Web designers, graphic designers

{% tab title="Populate a Record List from a Collection" %}
See how to populate a [Record List](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/record-list-control-settings.md) control from records in a [ProcessMaker Collection](../collections/what-is-a-collection.md).

* **Intended audience:** Process designers, Web designers, graphic designers, software developers, coding engineers
* **Viewing time:** 10 minutes; contains narration
* **Tags:** form; web form; design form; form design; [ProcessMaker Data Connector](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md); [ProcessMaker Collection](../collections/what-is-a-collection.md); [ProcessMaker Screen](../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md); [Screen Builder](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/); [Record List](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/record-list-control-settings.md) control; demo; video

{% tab title="Design Dependent Fields" %}
### Example 1

This example demonstrates dependent fields: how the options in one [Select List](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/select-list-control-settings.md) control depend on which option is selected from a previous Select List control. This example demonstrates that after a country is selected from one Select List control, a second Select List control contains as options the states and/or provinces in that selected country.

The Select List control that contains the countries as its options gets those options from a [ProcessMaker Data Connector](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md) that uses an [Endpoint](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-an-endpoint.md) to get the list of countries and their corresponding ISO codes from a third-party application program interface \(API\). A [Watcher](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/manage-watchers/what-is-a-watcher.md) monitors when a country is selected, and then another ProcessMaker Data Connector uses an Endpoint to get the list of states and/or provinces from that selected country based on that country's ISO code. The Watcher stores that list of states/provinces as a Request variable in that Request's data so that the second Select List control may access that list to display as its options. The second Select List control's options depend on the first Select List control's selection.

* **Tags:** [ProcessMaker Data Connector](../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md); [ProcessMaker Screen](../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md); [Select List](../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/select-list-control-settings.md) control; dependent controls; dependent fields; API; application program interface; third-party API call; demo; video

## Use the ProcessMaker API and SDKs

This section contains videos how to use the [ProcessMaker RESTful Application Program Interface \(API\)](https://staging-pm4.processmaker.net/api/documentation) and ProcessMaker's Software Development Kits \(SDKs\). Every function that you may do in ProcessMaker's elegant and well-designed user interface makes an API call. Since every ProcessMaker function is supported in the ProcessMaker API, ProcessMaker can be [white-labeled](../processmaker-administration/user-interface-language-management/what-is-user-interface-language-management.md) to run behind the scenes from other SaaS applications. Learn how you can use the ProcessMaker API.
