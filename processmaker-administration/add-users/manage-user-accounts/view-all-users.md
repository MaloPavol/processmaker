# View Users Accounts

## View All ProcessMaker User Accounts <a id="view-all-scripts"></a>

ProcessMaker displays all ProcessMaker user accounts in one table that ProcessMaker Administrators throughout your organization have created. This makes it easy to manage ProcessMaker user accounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Users: View Users" permission to view the list of users unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected.

See the [Users](../../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#users) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to view all ProcessMaker user accounts in your organization:

1. [Log on](../../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Admin** option from the top menu. The **Users** tab displays all ProcessMaker user accounts that have not been deleted. For deleted ProcessMaker user accounts, see [View Deleted User Accounts](manage-deleted-user-accounts/view-or-edit-deleted-user-accounts.md#view-all-scripts).

{% hint style="info" %}
Click the **Users** ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/users-icon-admin.png) icon from the left sidebar to view the **Users** tab when you are viewing other administrative-related pages.
{% endhint %}

* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker user account was created. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-processmaker-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
