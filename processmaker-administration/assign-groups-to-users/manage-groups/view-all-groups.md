# View Groups

## View All ProcessMaker Groups <a id="view-all-scripts"></a>

ProcessMaker displays all ProcessMaker groups in one table that ProcessMaker Administrators throughout your organization have created. This makes it easy to manage ProcessMaker groups.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Groups: View Groups" permission to view the list of groups unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected.

See the [Groups](../../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#groups) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to view all ProcessMaker groups in your organization:

1. [Log on](../../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Admin** option from the top menu. The **Users** page displays.
3. Click the **Groups** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/groups-icon-admin.png) from the left sidebar. The **Groups** page displays all ProcessMaker groups.

The **Groups** page displays the following information in tabular format about ProcessMaker groups:

* **Name:** The **Name** column displays the name of the ProcessMaker group.
* **Description:** The **Description** column displays the description for the ProcessMaker group.
* **Status:** The **Status** column displays one of the following statuses for the ProcessMaker group:
  * **Active:** An Active ProcessMaker group is one to which ProcessMaker user accounts can be assigned as members.
  * **Inactive:** An Inactive ProcessMaker group is one to which ProcessMaker user accounts cannot be assigned. When a ProcessMaker group becomes inactive, ProcessMaker user accounts that were members of that group are no longer members.
* **\#Users:** The **\# Users** column displays how many ProcessMaker users are members of the ProcessMaker group.
* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker group was last modified. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-processmaker-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker group was created.
