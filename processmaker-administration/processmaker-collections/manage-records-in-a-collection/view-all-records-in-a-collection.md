# View All Records in a Collection

## View All Records in a Collection

ProcessMaker displays all the records in a ProcessMaker [Collections](../what-is-a-collection.md) in one table.

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Collections package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The [Collections](../what-is-a-collection.md) package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Collections: View Collections" permission to view the list of ProcessMaker Collections unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected. See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.

Furthermore, your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the **View** [record permission](../manage-collections/configure-a-collection.md#configure-record-permissions-for-processmaker-users) from a Collection's configuration to view that Collection's records. See [Configure a Collection](../manage-collections/configure-a-collection.md#configure-a-processmaker-collection) or ask the manager of that ProcessMaker Collection for assistance.

The following information displays in tabular format about records in the ProcessMaker Collection:

* **\#:** The **\#** column displays the ID for the record. Use record IDs to [search for records in the ProcessMaker Collection](search-for-a-record-in-a-collection.md#search-records-in-a-processmaker-collection). ProcessMaker automatically generates the ID value when the record is created and represents a sequential number of how many total records in that Collection have been created to that time.
* **Modified By:** The **Modified By** column displays the ProcessMaker user who last modified the record. Hover your cursor over the user's avatar to view that person's full name.
* **Created By:** The **Created By** column displays the ProcessMaker user who created the record. Hover your cursor over the user's avatar to view that person's full name.
* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the record was last modified. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-processmaker-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the record was created. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-processmaker-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
