# Save and Share a Record Search

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Packages Required

To create and share [Saved Searches](../../../using-processmaker/save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/what-is-a-saved-search.md) for records in a ProcessMaker [Collection](../what-is-a-collection.md), the [Saved Searches package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) and the [Collections package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. Neither of these packages are available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how these packages can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Collections: View Collections" permission to view the list of ProcessMaker Collections unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected. See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.

Furthermore, your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the **View** [record permission](../manage-collections/configure-a-collection.md#configure-record-permissions-for-processmaker-users) from a Collection's configuration to view that Collection's records. See [Configure a Collection](../manage-collections/configure-a-collection.md#configure-a-processmaker-collection) or ask the manager of that ProcessMaker Collection for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Saved Searches package to save and share search parameters associated with [Requests](../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md), [Tasks](../../../using-processmaker/task-management/what-is-a-task.md) and [Collections](../what-is-a-collection.md). In doing so, you manage the search parameters for your Saved Searches. You may share your own Saved Searches with other ProcessMaker [users](../../add-users/what-is-a-user.md) and/or [groups](../../assign-groups-to-users/what-is-a-group.md). Recipients of your shared Saved Searches can only use your Saved Search to view its search results, but cannot modify your Saved Searches' parameter settings you configured.

See [Create and Share a Saved Search](../../../using-processmaker/save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/view-saved-searches-that-are-shared-with-you/create-and-share-a-saved-search.md#create-and-share-a-saved-search).
