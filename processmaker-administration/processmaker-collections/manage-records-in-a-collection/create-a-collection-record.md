{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Collections package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The [Collections](../what-is-a-collection.md) package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Collections: View Collections" permission to view the list of ProcessMaker Collections unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected. See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.

Furthermore, your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following [record permissions](../manage-collections/configure-a-collection.md#configure-record-permissions-for-processmaker-users) from a Collection's configuration that control how records in that Collection are accessed:

* View
* Create

See [Configure a Collection](../manage-collections/configure-a-collection.md#configure-a-processmaker-collection) or ask the manager of that ProcessMaker Collection for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Optionally, [import a Comma-Separated Values \(CSV\) file](create-multiple-collection-records-from-a-csv-file.md) from which to create multiple ProcessMaker Collection records simultaneously from the CSV's data records.

Follow these steps to create a new record in a ProcessMaker Collection:

1. [View the records for the ProcessMaker Collection](view-all-records-in-a-collection.md#view-all-records-in-a-collection) in which you want to add a record.
2. Click the **+Record** button. The **Create Record** page displays the ProcessMaker Screen configured to [create a record in this Collection](../manage-collections/create-a-new-collection.md#create-a-new-processmaker-collection).
3. Enter information for the new record as indicated in the ProcessMaker Screen.
4. Submit the new record as indicated in the ProcessMaker Screen. The new record [displays in the list of records for that ProcessMaker Collection](view-all-records-in-a-collection.md#view-all-records-in-a-collection).
