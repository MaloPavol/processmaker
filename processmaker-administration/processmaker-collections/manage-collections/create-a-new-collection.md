# Create a New Collection

## Overview

A ProcessMaker [Collection](../what-is-a-collection.md) uses at least two [Screens](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md) to create, edit, and view records in that Collection:

* **Create a record:** Have available a [Form-type](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#form) ProcessMaker Screen to create a record in the Collection. Ensure that this ProcessMaker Screen contains all the appropriate Screen controls required for authorized Collection stakeholders to create a complete record.
* **Edit a record:** Either use the same ProcessMaker Screen that creates a record, or have available a second Form-type Screen to edit any record in the Collection. Ensure that this ProcessMaker Screen contains all the appropriate Screen controls for authorized Collection stakeholders to edit or update particular content of a record in the Collection. In many cases, the controls to create a record may be identical to those to edit a record. If you want to use a second ProcessMaker Screen, optionally [make a copy](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/manage-forms/duplicate-a-screen.md#duplicate-a-processmaker-screen) of the Screen intended to create a record, and then make changes to it without needing to design a new Screen.
* **View a record:** Have available a [Display-type](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#display) ProcessMaker Screen to view any record in the Collection. This ProcessMaker Screen may serve two purposes:
  * **Provide a read-only view of a complete record:** This allows authorized Collection stakeholders to view complete contents of any record in the Collection, but not edit or update it.
  * **Limit the information displayed in a record:** This allows authorized Collection stakeholders to view limited content of any record in the Collection to comply with specific legal or privacy requirements.

Ensure these ProcessMaker Screens are available before creating a new ProcessMaker Collection. You are not required to have the controls in these ProcessMaker Screens finalized, as you or an authorized ProcessMaker designer may change these Screens at any time. Doing so updates all records within that ProcessMaker Collection automatically.

## Create a New ProcessMaker Collection

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Collections package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The [Collections](../what-is-a-collection.md) package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to create a ProcessMaker Collection unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Collections: Create Collections
* Collections: View Collections

These permissions are different than [record permissions](configure-a-collection.md#configure-record-level-permissions-for-users) in a ProcessMaker Collection that allow you to view or create records in that Collection.

See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to create a ProcessMaker Collection:

1. [View your ProcessMaker Collections](view-collections.md#view-all-collections). The **Collections** page displays.
2. Click the **+Collection** button. The **Create Collection** screen displays. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/create-collection-screen-package.png) 
3. In the **Title** field, enter the name of the ProcessMaker Collection. This name must be unique from all other ProcessMaker Collections. This is a required field.
4. In the **Description** field, enter the description of the ProcessMaker Collection. This is a required field.
5. From the **Create Screen** drop-down menu, select the ProcessMaker Screen from which new records in this Collection are created. This must be a [form-type](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#form) ProcessMaker Screen. This is a required field.
6. From the **View Screen** drop-down menu, select the ProcessMaker Screen from which to view records in this Collection. Use this ProcessMaker Screen to only display all or parts of a record in the Collection. For example, the ProcessMaker Screen selected from the **View Screen** drop-down menu may be designed to not display sensitive information that all Collection stakeholders should have access. This must be a [display-type](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#display) ProcessMaker Screen. This is a required field.
7. From the **Edit Screen** drop-down menu, select the ProcessMaker Screen from which to edit or update records in this Collection. This can be the same or a different ProcessMaker Screen as selected from the **Create Screen** drop-down menu. This is a required field.
8. Click **Save**. The ProcessMaker Collection displays an empty list of records for that Collection so you may create your first record. See [Create a Collection Record](../manage-records-in-a-collection/create-a-collection-record.md). Furthermore, the Collection icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/collection-icon-package.png)displays access to the ProcessMaker Collection from the left sidebar of the **Collections** page. See [View Records in a Collection](../manage-records-in-a-collection/view-all-records-in-a-collection.md#view-all-records-in-a-collection).

{% hint style="info" %}
The ProcessMaker Collection also creates a [Data Connector](../../../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md) that uses the ProcessMaker Collection name so that Collection records can be acted upon from ProcessMaker assets. See [Endpoints for ProcessMaker Collections](../../../designing-processes/data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md#endpoints-for-processmaker-collections).
