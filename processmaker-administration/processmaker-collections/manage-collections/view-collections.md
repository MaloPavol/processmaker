# View Collections

## View All Collections

ProcessMaker displays all the ProcessMaker [Collections](../what-is-a-collection.md) in one table. This makes it easy to manage ProcessMaker Collections.

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Collections package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The [Collections](../what-is-a-collection.md) package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permission Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Collections: View Collections" permission to view the list of ProcessMaker Collections unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected. This permission is different than [record permissions](configure-a-collection.md#configure-record-level-permissions-for-users) in a ProcessMaker Collection that allow you to view the records in that Collection.

See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to view all ProcessMaker Collections in your organization:

1. Ensure that you are [logged on](../../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Admin** option from the top menu. The **Users** page displays.
3. Click the **Collections** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/collections-icon-admin.png)in the left sidebar. The **Collections** page displays the ProcessMaker Collections that you are allowed to view.

![&quot;Collections&quot; page displays all ProcessMaker Collections in your organization](../../../.gitbook/assets/collections-page-package.png)

The **Collections** page displays the following information in tabular format about ProcessMaker Collections:

* **Collection ID:** The **Collection ID** column displays the ProcessMaker Collection's ID. ProcessMaker automatically generates the ID value when the Collection is created and represents a sequential number of how many total Collections have been created to that time.
* **Name:** The **Name** column displays the ProcessMaker Collection's name.
* **\# Records:** The **\# Records** column displays how many records are in each ProcessMaker Collection.
* **Modified By:** The **Modified By** column displays the ProcessMaker user who last modified the Collection. Hover your cursor over the user's avatar to view that person's full name.
* **Created By:** The **Created By** column displays the ProcessMaker user who created the Collection. Hover your cursor over the user's avatar to view that person's full name.
* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker Collection was last modified. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-processmaker-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker Collection was created. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-processmaker-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
