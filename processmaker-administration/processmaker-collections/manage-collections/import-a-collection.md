# Import a Collection

## Overview

Import a ProcessMaker Collection that has been [exported](export-a-collection.md) from the same [ProcessMaker version](../../../using-processmaker/application-version-details.md#view-processmaker-version-information). The imported ProcessMaker Screen contains the [records](../manage-records-in-a-collection/view-all-records-in-a-collection.md#view-all-records-in-a-collection) and the [ProcessMaker Screens](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md) from the exported Collection. Exported ProcessMaker Collections have the `.json` file extension.

The [Collections package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The [Collections](../what-is-a-collection.md) package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to import a ProcessMaker Collection unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Collections: View Collections

See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
