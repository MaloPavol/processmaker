{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

To email a report of a [Saved Search](../what-is-a-saved-search.md) data details, the [Saved Searches package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

Email a report of the currently displayed search results for a Saved Search to one or more email recipients. In doing so, those search results are emailed as a comma-separated values \(`.CSV`\) file that can be opened in a spreadsheet editor. Email recipients receive the Saved Search results as an attachment to the email. Separate multiple email recipients using commas.

Follow these steps to email a report of search results for a Saved Search:

1. [View the search results for a Saved Search](view-search-results-for-a-saved-search.md) in which to email its search results.
2. Click the **Send Report** button. The **Email Report** screen displays. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/email-report-screen-saved-search-package.png) 
3. In the **Send to** setting, enter the email address\(es\) for the email recipients to receive the report. Separate multiple email recipients using commas.
4. In the **Email Subject** setting, enter the email subject of your report to which the report will be attached.
5. In the **Email Body** setting, enter the email body content for your report.
6. Click **Send**. Email recipients receive the Saved Search results as an attachment to the email.
