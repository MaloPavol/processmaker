# Task Data Type PMQL Properties

## Overview

The following ProcessMaker Query Language \(PMQL\) properties apply to the `Task` data type to perform PMQL search queries from any of the pages accessible from the **Tasks** top menu option. Selecting any PMQL search result displays the Task summary for that result.

* [`completed` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#completed-datetime-task-completed)
* [`created` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#created-tasks-creation-datetime)
* [`data` object](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#data-object-search-request-data-for-specific-request-information)
* [`due` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#due-datetime-task-is-or-was-due)
* [`element_id` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#element_id-task-node-identifier-from-the-process-model)
* [`id` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#id-task-id-number)
* [`modified` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#modified-datetime-task-last-modified)
* [`process_id` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#process_id-process-id-number-associated-with-the-task)
* [`request` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#request-request-name-associated-with-the-task)
* [`started` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#started-datetime-task-started)
* [`status` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#status-task-status)
* [`task` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#task-task-name)

## `completed`: Datetime Task Completed

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`completed` property represents when the Task completes. The `completed` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Request that created the sought Task\(s\).

#### Datetime Format

Enter the datetime in the PMQL search query within quotation marks in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` using 24-hour time. Example: `"2020-07-01 14:25:15"`.

#### `NOW` Keyword

Use the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword) to dynamically compare the current datetime with a specified number of chronological units. Use the Less Than [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#operators-and-grouping-multiple-criteria) \(`<`\) followed by the number of chronological units to search for Requests of that age. Note that the interval unit of time is singular. PMQL supports the following units of time:

* second
* minute
* hour
* day
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find completed Tasks named Student Registration in the Student Enrollment Process that completed after they were due three days ago.

Note the following:

* This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to require multiple property values for the search.
* This example uses the [`task` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#task-task-name). The `task` property value \(`"Student Registration"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`request` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#request-request-name-associated-with-the-task). The `request` property value \(`"Student Enrollment Process"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword-to-perform-temporal-comparisons-from-now) to represent the current datetime, and then uses the Less Than operator \(`<`\) to determine the datetime four \(4\) days ago for completed Tasks that completed later than when they were due three \(3\) days ago. Note that the unit of chronological measurements \(`day`\) is singular.
* [Note when PMQL search queries are case sensitive](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#lower-function-to-disregard-case-sensitivity-in-strings-and-request-variables).

```text
(task = "Student Registration") AND (request = "Student Enrollment Process") AND (completed < NOW -4 day)
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find completed Tasks named Submit Employment Application in the Candidate Review Process in which employment candidates had programming experience in at least JavaScript and Python and had "Manager" in a job title.

This example uses the [`LIKE` operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#like-operator-for-wildcard-pattern-matching) to find text in a specified JSON array within Request data. For example, PMQL finds the string `JavaScript` in the key name `CodingLanguages` regardless of what string precedes or follows the sought pattern because the `%` wildcard before and after the sought pattern disregards all content in the JSON array preceding and following that pattern, respectively.

This example uses the [`data` object](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#data-object-search-request-data-for-specific-request-information) that represents Request data. The following Request variables store Request data that this PMQL search query references:

* **CodingLanguages:** The `CodingLanguages` Request variable stores one or more selections from a [Select List](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/select-list-control-settings.md) control of programming languages in which the employment candidate has experience. The Request data stores the Select List control selection\(s\) in a JSON array that contains both the value and content for each option in the Select List control.
* **JobTitle:** The `JobTitle` Request variable stores the job title for each position the employment candidate held. A [Loop](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/loop-control-settings.md) control called `Jobs` contains a set of controls to enter information about each position the candidate held, among them being a [Line Input](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/line-input-control-settings.md) control called `JobTitle`.

```text
(status = "Completed") AND (task = "Submit Employment Application") AND (request = "Candidate Review Process") AND ((data.CodingLanguages LIKE "%JavaScript%") AND (data.CodingLanguages LIKE "%Python%")) AND (data.Jobs.JobTitle LIKE "%Manager%")
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `created`: Task's Creation Datetime

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`created` property represents when the Request creates the Task. The `created` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Request that created the sought Task\(s\).

#### Datetime Format

Enter the datetime in the PMQL search query within quotation marks in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` using 24-hour time. Example: `"2020-07-01 14:25:15"`.

#### `NOW` Keyword

Use the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword) to dynamically compare the current datetime with a specified number of chronological units. Use the Less Than [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#operators-and-grouping-multiple-criteria) \(`<`\) followed by the number of chronological units to search for Requests of that age. Note that the interval unit of time is singular. PMQL supports the following units of time:

* second
* minute
* hour
* day

{% hint style="info" %}
See Examples 1 and 2 how this property can apply to Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) contract compliance.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find created Tasks from two hours ago named Package Purchased Items in the Fulfill Purchase Delivery Process that started less than 30 minutes ago.

Note the following:

* This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to require multiple property values for the search.
* This example uses the [`task` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#task-task-name). The `task` property value \(`"Package Purchased Items"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`request` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#request-request-name-associated-with-the-task). The `request` property value \(`"Fulfill Purchase Delivery Process"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`started` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#started-datetime-task-started) to find those Tasks that started 30 minutes ago.
* This example uses the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword-to-perform-temporal-comparisons-from-now) to represent the current datetime, and then uses the Less Than operator \(`<`\) to determine the datetime two \(2\) hours ago and 30 minutes ago that the applicable Task\(s\) was created and started, respectively. Note that the unit of chronological measurements \(`hour` and `minute`\) are singular.
* [Note when PMQL search queries are case sensitive](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#lower-function-to-disregard-case-sensitivity-in-strings-and-request-variables).

```text
(created < NOW -2 hour) AND (started < NOW -30 minute) AND (task = "Package Purchased Items") AND (request = "Fulfill Purchase Delivery Process")
```

{% hint style="info" %}
### Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) Use Case

Use a PMQL search query similar to this example to monitor how much time passes from when a Task was created and that Task starts. A PMQL query similar to this example can determine which Tasks are being started later than the sanctioned time period a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) contract allows from when that Task was created. For example, if a SLA contract states that a Task applicable to the contract must start within 1.5 hours from when its Request creates it, use a PMQL search query similar to this example to find only those Tasks that started less than 30 minutes ago, therefore longer than the 1.5 hours allowed by the SLA contract.
{% endhint %}

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find created Tasks associated with the **Node Identifier** setting value `node_6` in Requests associated with Process ID 12 from two hours ago that have completed less than 30 minutes ago.

Note the following:

* This example uses the [`element_id` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#element_id-task-node-identifier-from-the-process-model) to reference the **Node Identifier** setting value \(`node_6`\) from the Process model for the sought Task's element.
* This example uses the [`process_id` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#process_id-process-id-number-associated-with-the-task) to reference the Process ID number \(`12`\) associated with the sought Task\(s\).
* This example uses the [`completed` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#completed-datetime-task-completed). The `completed` property value compares the datetime that the Task completed.

```text
(created < NOW -2 hour) AND (completed < NOW -30 minute) AND (element_id = "node_6") AND (process_id = 12)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
### Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) Use Case

Use a PMQL search query similar to this example to monitor how much time passes from when a Task was created and that Task completes. A PMQL query similar to this example can determine which Tasks are being completed later than the sanctioned time period a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) contract allows from when that Task was created. Unlike Example 1 that identifies the Task to monitor by its name, this example identifies the Task by its **Node Identifier** setting value in a specified Process model. Otherwise, this example serves a similar purpose to monitor SLA contract compliance as does Example 1.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `data` object: Search Request Data for Specific Request Information

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
Use the `data` JSON object to search for Request data associated with the sought Task\(s\). The `data` JSON object represents Request data: each Request's JSON data model contains the accumulation of all JSON objects and arrays for that Request. The `data` JSON object also contains the record data for a ProcessMaker Collection. The key names for each JSON object or array derive from the **Variable Name** setting values in the ProcessMaker Screens used for Tasks in each Request or any data injected into that Request's JSON data model by ProcessMaker Scripts run via Script Task elements or calls to the ProcessMaker RESTful Application Program Interface \(API\).

Using the `data` JSON object in PQML search queries helps answer the question "Which Request\(s\) have specific information in them for Tasks that I seek?" Use [operators](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to compare the value for a particular ProcessMaker Screen control to find Requests that only contain the value\(s\) you seek. For example:

* Search for Requests that apply to a specific customer in a Loan Request Process.
* Search for Requests in a Purchase Request Process in which a purchase request amount is greater than $500 but less than $10,000.
* Search for which registered conference attendees that were required to enter their job title are similar to "Product Manager," such as "Project Manager."

To determine what the **Variable Name** setting is for a control that stores Request information you seek, do one of the following:

* View the ProcessMaker Screen for the Task in which Request participants enter the information you seek, and then make note of the pertinent control's **Variable Name** setting. Note that your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the **Screens: View Screens** permission.
* View the [**Data** tab in the summary for a completed Request](../../requests/request-details/summary-for-completed-requests.md#editable-request-data) to view the data from a completed Request, and then use the specific key name \(represented in red-colored text\) to search Request information from that control. Spaces are allowed between operators. Example: `data.last_name = "Canera"`. Note that your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the [Requests: Edit Request Data](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#requests) permission. Ask your ProcessMaker Administrator if you do not see the **Data** tab in completed Requests.

The `data` JSON object precedes the **Variable Name** setting value, as noted above. Use JSON dot notation to reference sub-properties in the referenced ProcessMaker Screen control if necessary. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find in-progress Tasks named Approve Semester Courses in the Student Enrollment Process in which Business majors have enrolled in at least 18 credits this semester.

When submitting which courses to enroll that semester, each student must enter the following information into a ProcessMaker Screen that becomes Request data when that Screen is submitted:

* A [Select List](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/select-list-control-settings.md) control of which its **Variable Name** setting is `Major` stores the JSON object value for the option that each student selects as a major.
* A [Line Input](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/line-input-control-settings.md) control of which its **Variable Name** setting is `TotalCredits` stores as an integer the sum of all credits that the student selected for enrollment.

Note the following:

* This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to require multiple property values for the search.
* This example uses the [`status` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#status-task-status). The `status` property values \(such as `"in progress"`\) are not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`task` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#task-task-name). The `task` property value \(`"Approve Semester Courses"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`request` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#request-request-name-associated-with-the-task). The `request` property value \(`"Student Enrollment Process"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* [Note when PMQL search queries are case sensitive](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#lower-function-to-disregard-case-sensitivity-in-strings-and-request-variables).

```text
(status = "in progress") AND (task = "Approve Semester Courses") AND (request = "Student Enrollment Process") AND (data.Major = "Business") AND (data.TotalCredits >= 18)
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find completed Tasks named Submit Leave Request in the Leave Request Process in which the reason those employees requested leave was illness between the dates March 15, 2020, and April 30, 2020.

When submitting a leave request, each employee must select from one of several options in a ~~Checkbox~~ control to indicate the reason for the leave request. The Checkbox control has a **Variable Name** setting of `LeaveType`; the option that indicates the reason is for medical leave has an option value of `Medical`. Therefore, to find those completed Tasks in which the reason for leave is illness, use the following in the PMQL search query: `data.LeaveType = "Medical"`. The PMQL search query is case sensitive.

Note the following:

* This example uses the [`completed` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#completed-datetime-task-completed). Each use of the `completed` property compares the datetime that the Task completed.
* PMQL interprets strings in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` as dates and can be used in comparative queries if that string is in quotation marks \(`"2020-03-15 00:00:00"`\).

```text
(status = "completed") AND (task = "Submit Leave Request") AND (request = "Leave Request") AND (data.LeaveType = "Medical") AND (completed >= "2020-03-15 00:00:00") AND (completed <= "2020-04-30 00:00:00")
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `due`: Datetime Task Is or Was Due

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`due` property represents when the Task is or was due. The `due` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Request that created the sought Task\(s\).

#### Datetime Format

Enter the datetime in the PMQL search query within quotation marks in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` using 24-hour time. Example: `"2020-07-01 14:25:15"`.

#### `NOW` Keyword

Use the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword) to dynamically compare the current datetime with a specified number of chronological units. Use the Less Than [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#operators-and-grouping-multiple-criteria) \(`<`\) followed by the number of chronological units to search for Requests of that age. Note that the interval unit of time is singular. PMQL supports the following units of time:

* second
* minute
* hour

{% hint style="info" %}
See Example 2 how this property can apply to Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) contract compliance.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find Tasks named Loan Review that are due in two days for the Loan Approval Process.

Note the following:

* This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to require multiple property values for the search.
* This example uses the [`task` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#task-task-name). The `task` property value \(`"Loan Review"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`request` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#request-request-name-associated-with-the-task). The `request` property value \(`"Loan Approval Process"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword-to-perform-temporal-comparisons-from-now) to represent the current datetime, and then uses the Greater Than operator \(`>`\) to determine the datetime two \(2\) days from now for due Tasks. Note that the unit of chronological measurements \(`day`\) is singular.
* [Note when PMQL search queries are case sensitive](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#lower-function-to-disregard-case-sensitivity-in-strings-and-request-variables).

```text
(due > NOW +2 day) AND (task = "Loan Review") AND (request = "Loan Approval Process")
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find Tasks that completed 20 minutes ago that were past due for Requests associated with process ID 25.

Note the following:

* This example uses the [`completed` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#completed-datetime-task-completed). The `completed` property compares the datetime that the Task completed. Since the PMQL search query finds completed Tasks past due, the `due` property uses the Greater Than operator \(`>`\) to find Tasks that were due later than 20 minutes ago. 
* This example uses the [`process_id` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#process_id-process-id-number-associated-with-the-task) with a value of `25` to find Requests associated with that Process.

```text
(completed = NOW -20 minute) AND (due > NOW -20 minute) AND (process_id = 25)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
### Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) Use Case

Use a PMQL search query similar to this example to monitor which Tasks were due previously to when they completed, thereby determining which completed Tasks were not compliant with a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) contract.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `element_id`: Task Node Identifier from the Process Model

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`element_id` property is the **Node Identifier** setting value from the Process model for the sought Task's element. The `element_id` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Process model that started the sought Task\(s\).

Enter the node identifier value in the PMQL search query within quotation marks. The node identifier value is not case-sensitive. Example: `"node_15"`.

if you have [Process](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#processes) permissions to edit Process models, then determine the **Node Identifier** setting value for a Form Task, Manual Task or Script Task element by doing the following:

1. Ensure that the **Hide Menus** button![](../../../.gitbook/assets/hide-menus-button-process-modeler-processes.png)is not enabled. See [Maximize the Process Modeler Canvas View](../../../designing-processes/process-design/navigate-around-your-process-model.md#maximize-the-process-modeler-canvas-view).
2. Select the Form Task, Manual Task, or Script Task element from the Process model from which to include in the PMQL search query. Panels to configure this element display.
3. Expand the **Advanced** panel if it is not presently expanded. The **Node Identifier** setting value displays.

{% hint style="info" %}
See Example 2 how this property can apply to Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) contract compliance.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find in-progress Tasks associated with the **Node Identifier** setting value `node_4` in Requests associated with Process ID 10.

Note the following:

* This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to require multiple property values for the search.
* This example uses the [`status` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#status-task-status). The `status` property values \(such as `"in progress"`\) are not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`process_id` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#process_id-process-id-number-associated-with-the-task) with a value of `10` to find Requests associated with that Process.
* [Note when PMQL search queries are case sensitive](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#lower-function-to-disregard-case-sensitivity-in-strings-and-request-variables).

```text
(element_id = "node_4") AND (status = "in progress") AND (process_id = 10)
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find in-progress Tasks associated with the **Node Identifier** setting value `node_4` in Requests associated with Process ID 10 that started two days ago.

Note the following:

* This example uses the [`started` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#started-datetime-task-started) in conjunction with the `NOW` keyword, described below.
* This example uses the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword-to-perform-temporal-comparisons-from-now) to represent the current datetime, and then uses the Less Than operator \(`<`\) to determine the datetime two \(2\) days ago that the applicable Task\(s\) started. Note that the unit of chronological measurement \(`day`\) is singular.

```text
(element_id = "node_4") AND (status = "in progress") AND (process_id = 10) AND (started < NOW -2 day)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
### Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) Use Case

Use a PMQL search query similar to this example to monitor which started Tasks are at risk of completing past the sanctioned time period a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) contract allows. For example, if a SLA contract states that a Task applicable to the contract must complete within three \(3\) days from when it starts, use a PMQL search query similar to this example to find only those Tasks that started two days ago to determine which are at risk of not complying with the SLA contract.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `id`: Task ID Number

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`id` property represents the Task ID number for the sought Task\(s\). The `id` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Request that started the sought Task\(s\).

This id property only applies to Task-related PMQL search queries, and is distinct from the [`id` property for the `Request` data type](pmql-properties-for-the-request-data-type.md#id-request-id-number) or for the [`id` property for the `Collection` data type](collection-data-type-pmql-properties.md#id-collection-record-id-number).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find Tasks that are newer than Task ID 5.

```text
id > 5
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find Tasks newer than Task ID 5 but older or the same as Task ID 10.

This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to require multiple property values for the search.

```text
(id > 5) AND (id <= 10)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `modified`: Datetime Task Last Modified

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`modified` property represents when the Task was last modified. A Task modifies when the JSON object model to which that Task applies is changed from a ProcessMaker [Script](../../../designing-processes/scripts/what-is-a-script.md), a ProcessMaker [user](../../../processmaker-administration/add-users/what-is-a-user.md) action, an application program interface \(API\) call, or any other means. The `modified` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Request that created the sought Task\(s\).

#### Datetime Format

Enter the datetime in the PMQL search query within quotation marks in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` using 24-hour time. Example: `"2020-07-01 14:25:15"`.

#### `NOW` Keyword

Use the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword) to dynamically compare the current datetime with a specified number of chronological units. Use the Less Than [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#operators-and-grouping-multiple-criteria) \(`<`\) followed by the number of chronological units to search for Requests of that age. Note that the interval unit of time is singular. PMQL supports the following units of time:

* second
* minute
* hour
* day
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find Tasks modified 20 minutes ago named Loan Information in the Loan Application Process.

Note the following:

* This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to require multiple property values for the search.
* This example uses the [`task` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#task-task-name). The `task` property value \(`"Loan Information"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`request` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#request-request-name-associated-with-the-task). The `request` property value \(`"Loan Application Process"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword-to-perform-temporal-comparisons-from-now) to represent the current datetime, and then uses the Less Than operator \(`<`\) to determine the datetime 20 minutes ago that the applicable Task\(s\) were modified. Note that the unit of chronological measurement \(`minute`\) is singular.
* [Note when PMQL search queries are case sensitive](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#lower-function-to-disregard-case-sensitivity-in-strings-and-request-variables).

```text
(modified < NOW -20 minute) AND (task = "Loan Information") AND (request = "Loan Application Process")
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find any Task modified between 30 minutes ago and one hour which have "approval" in its name from Requests associated with Process ID 25.

Note the following:

* This example uses the [`process_id` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#process_id-process-id-number-associated-with-the-task) to reference the Process ID number \(`25`\) associated with the sought Task\(s\).
* This example uses the [`LIKE` operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#like-operator-for-wildcard-pattern-matching) with the `%` wildcard to search for any Task name that includes the characters `approval` in its name.

```text
(modified < NOW -30 minute) AND (modified < NOW -1 hour) AND (task = "%approval%") AND (process_id = 25)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `process_id`: Process ID Number Associated with the Task

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`process_ID` property represents the Process ID number associated with the sought Task\(s\). The `process_ID` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Process model associated with the Process ID that started the sought Task\(s\).

Process IDs do not display in the **Processes** page. However, if you have [Process](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#processes) permissions to edit Process models, then determine the Process ID by doing the following:

1. [View your Processes](../../../designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-active-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. Click the **Open Modeler** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-modeler-edit-icon-processes-page-processes.png)to edit the Process model associated with the sought Requests. Process Modeler displays.
3. From the Web browser address bar, note the number immediately after `modeler/`. This number is the Process ID to use with the `process_id` property.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find Tasks associated with Process IDs are 3 and 7.

This example uses the `OR` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to search for any of multiple properties.

```text
(process_id = 3 OR process_id = 7)
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find Tasks that exclude those for Process ID 5. This example uses the Not Equal To operator \(`!=`\) to find all Tasks except those associated with Process ID 5.

```text
process_id != 5
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `request`: Request Name Associated with the Task

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`request` represents the Request's name associated with the sought Task\(s\). The `request` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Process model that started the sought Task\(s\).

Request names display in the **Name** column of Request pages. The **Name** column displays the Process name associated with the Request.

Enter the `request` property value in quotation marks. Example: `"Request Name"`. The property value is not case-sensitive.

{% hint style="info" %}
See Example 2 how this property can apply to Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) contract compliance.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find completed Tasks started from either the Residential Loan Approval Process or the Business Loan Approval Process.

Note the following:

* This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to search for multiple required property values.
* This example uses the `OR` operator to search for any of multiple properties within an `AND` operator to find Tasks for either the "Residential Loan Approval Process" or "Business Loan Approval Process" Requests.
* This example uses the [`status` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#status-task-status). The `status` property values \(such as `"completed"`\) are not case-sensitive.
* [Note when PMQL search queries are case sensitive](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#lower-function-to-disregard-case-sensitivity-in-strings-and-request-variables).

```text
(status = "completed") AND ((request = "Residential Loan Approval Process") OR (request = "Business Loan Approval Process"))
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find in-progress Tasks started one hour ago for the Purchase Order Fulfillment Process for which the purchase order amount is at least $10,000 for Acme Corporation.

Note that this example uses the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword-to-perform-temporal-comparisons-from-now) to represent the current datetime, and then uses the Less Than operator \(`<`\) to determine the datetime one hour ago that the applicable Task\(s\) started. Note that the unit of chronological measurement \(`hour`\) is singular, even if the sought Task\(s\) is more than one hour old.

This example uses the [`data` object](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#data-object-search-request-data-for-specific-request-information) that represents Request data. The following Request variables store Request data that this PMQL search query references:

* **TotalPurchase:** The `TotalPurchase` Request variable stores the total purchase request amount, including applicable taxes.
* **Customer:** The `Customer` Request variable stores the business name for which the purchase order fulfillment applies.

```text
(request = "Purchase Order Fulfillment Process") AND (status = "in progress") AND (started < NOW -1 hour) AND (data.TotalPurchase >= 10000) AND (data.Customer = "Acme Corporation")
```

{% hint style="info" %}
### Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) Use Case

Use a PMQL search query similar to this example to track which started Tasks are at risk of completing past the sanctioned time period a Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) contract allows. For example, if a SLA contract states that a Task applicable to the contract must complete within two \(2\) hours from when it starts for specific customers and/or for specific purchase order amounts, use a PMQL search query similar to this example to find only those Tasks that an hour ago to determine which are at risk of not complying with the SLA contract.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `started`: Datetime Task Started

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`started` property represents when the Task starts. The `started` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Request that started the sought Task\(s\).

The `started` property is similar to the [`created` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#created-tasks-creation-datetime), in that when a Task starts, it is created. The `created` property applies to when the ProcessMaker API creates a Task, while the `started` property pertains to when a ProcessMaker user uses the ProcessMaker user interface to start a Task.

#### Datetime Format

Enter the datetime in the PMQL search query within quotation marks in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` using 24-hour time. Example: `"2020-07-01 14:25:15"`.

#### `NOW` Keyword

Use the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword) to dynamically compare the current datetime with a specified number of chronological units. Use the Less Than [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#operators-and-grouping-multiple-criteria) \(`<`\) followed by the number of chronological units to search for Requests of that age. Note that the interval unit of time is singular. PMQL supports the following units of time:

* second
* minute
* hour
* day
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find in-progress Tasks named Submit Purchase Request that started on July 1, 2020, for the Purchase Request Process.

Note the following:

* This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to search for multiple required property values.
* This example uses the [`task` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#task-task-name). The `task` property value \(`"Submit Purchase Request"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`status` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#status-task-status). The `status` property values \(such as `"in progress"`\) are not case-sensitive.
* This example uses the [`request` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#request-request-name-associated-with-the-task). The `request` property value \(`"Purchase Request Process"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* [Note when PMQL search queries are case sensitive](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#lower-function-to-disregard-case-sensitivity-in-strings-and-request-variables).

```text
(task = "Submit Purchase Request") AND (status = "in progress") AND (started = "2020-07-01 00:00:00") AND (request = "Purchase Request Process")
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find completed Tasks named Purchase Authorization that started three  days ago associated with the Purchase Request Process for which the approved total purchase amount was more than $100,000.

Note that this example uses the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword-to-perform-temporal-comparisons-from-now) to represent the current datetime, and then uses the Less Than operator \(`<`\) to determine the datetime three \(3\) days ago that the applicable Task\(s\) started. Note that the unit of chronological measurement \(`day`\) is singular.

This example uses the [`data` object](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#data-object-search-request-data-for-specific-request-information) that represents Request data. The following Request variables store Request data that this PMQL search query references:

* **Approve:** The `Approve` Request variable stores whether a [Checkbox](../../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/control-descriptions/checkbox-control-settings.md) control is selected in the Form Task that approves a submitted purchase request. Since this example requires only approved purchases, this PMQL search query includes only `Approve` values of `true` that a Checkbox control stores when it is selected upon Task submission. The property value is not case-sensitive.
* **TotalPurchase:** The `TotalPurchase` Request variable stores the total purchase request amount, including applicable taxes.

```text
(task = "Purchase Authorization") AND (request = "Purchase Request Process") AND (status = "completed") AND (started < NOW -3 day) AND (data.Approve = "true") AND (data.TotalPurchase > 100000)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `status`: Task Status

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`status` property represents the Task status. The `status` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Request that started the sought Task\(s\).

Task status displays in the **Status** column of Task pages.

Enter the `status` property value in quotation marks. Example: `"in progress"`. The property value is not case-sensitive.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find in-progress Tasks for the Travel Request Process.

Note the following:

* This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to search for multiple required property values.
* This example uses the [`request` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#request-request-name-associated-with-the-task). The `request` property value \(`"Travel Request Process"`\) is not case-sensitive.
* [Note when PMQL search queries are case sensitive](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#lower-function-to-disregard-case-sensitivity-in-strings-and-request-variables).

```text
(status = "in progress") AND (request = "Travel Request Process")
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find in-progress Tasks for the Travel Request Process for which the business travel destination is to any municipality named Dallas except that in Texas to leave three \(3\) days from today.

Note that this example uses the [`NOW` keyword](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#now-keyword-to-perform-temporal-comparisons-from-now) to represent the current datetime, and then uses the Greater Than operator \(`>`\) to determine the datetime three days from now that the requested business travel is to occur as requested in the `LeaveDate` Request variable. Note that the unit of chronological measurement \(`day`\) is singular.

This example uses the [`data` object](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#data-object-search-request-data-for-specific-request-information) that represents Request data. The following Request variables store Request data that this PMQL search query references:

* **DestinationMunicipality:** The `DestinationMunicipality` Request variable stores to which municipality business travel is requested.
* **DestinationState:** The `DestinationState` Request variable stores to which state business travel is requested.
* **LeaveDate:** The `LeaveDate` Request variable stores at which datetime business travel is requested.

```text
(status = "in progress") AND (request = "Travel Request Process") AND (data.LeaveDate > NOW +3 day) AND (data.DestinationMunicipality = "Dallas") AND (data.DestinationState != "Texas")
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## `task`: Task Name

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
`task` property represents the Task name. The `task` property applies to Form Task, Manual Task, and/or Script Task elements from the Request that started the sought Task\(s\).

Task names display in the **Task** column of Task pages.

Enter the `task` property value in quotation marks. Example: `"TaskName"`. The property value is not case-sensitive.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Examples" %}
### Example 1

**Purpose of the search:** Find completed Tasks named Review Risk Rating.

Note the following:

* This example uses the `AND` [operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#comparative-and-logical-operators) to search for multiple required property values.
* This example uses the [`status` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#status-task-status). The `status` property values \(such as `"in progress"`\) are not case-sensitive.
* [Note when PMQL search queries are case sensitive](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#lower-function-to-disregard-case-sensitivity-in-strings-and-request-variables).

```text
(task = "Review Risk Rating") AND (status = "completed")
```

### Example 2

**Purpose of the search:** Find in-progress Tasks that contain the word "review" in its name for Requests associated with process ID 12.

Note the following:

* This example uses the [`LIKE` operator](../syntax-to-search-processmaker-data.md#like-operator-for-wildcard-pattern-matching) with the `%` wildcard to search for any Task name that includes the characters `review` in its name.
* This example uses the [`process_id` property](task-data-type-pmql-properties.md#process_id-process-id-number-associated-with-the-task) with a value of `12` to find Requests associated with that Process.

```text
(task LIKE "%review%") AND (status = "in progress") AND (process_id = 12)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
