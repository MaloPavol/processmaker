# View a Task Summary

## Summary for an Assigned Task

Follow these steps to view the summary for an assigned Task:

1. Ensure that you are [logged on](../log-in.md#log-on) to ProcessMaker.
2. [View all assigned Tasks.](view-tasks-you-need-to-do.md#view-your-assigned-tasks) The **To Do Tasks** page displays.
3. Click the name of the Task from the **Name** column. The Task's [form](view-a-task-summary.md#form), Request [data](view-a-task-summary.md#data), and Task [summary](view-a-task-summary.md#summary) display.

Below is an example of a Task summary.

### Task Form

The assigned Task displays in the **Form** tab. The **Form** tab displays by default when an assigned Task is opened. The Form tab displays information differently depending on whether ProcessMaker software is involved in the task's activity:

* **Forms in which ProcessMaker software is involved with the activity:** The **Form** tab displays an interactive [ProcessMaker Screen](../../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md), which is a [Form](../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#form)-type Screen. Form-type ProcessMaker Screens allow Request participants to enter, review, and/or make decisions based on information in the form. Below is an example of a Task in which ProcessMaker software is involved with the activity.  

  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/forms-tab-assigned-to-do-summary-tasks.png)

* **Forms in which ProcessMaker software is not involved with the activity:** The **Form** tab displays a ProcessMaker Screen that only displays a message. This is a [Display](../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#display)-type Screen that allows the Task assignee to do a manual task in which ProcessMaker software is not directly involved, such as moving inventory containers. When the manual Task is complete, the Task assignee clicks the **Complete Task** button. Below is an example of a Task in which ProcessMaker software is not involved with the activity.

### Editable Task Data

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the "Requests: Edit Task Data" permission to edit Task data unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected.

See the [Request](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker/processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups#requests) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

The **Data** tab displays in JSON format the data a previous participant of this Request entered. Values in the **Data** tab can be changed from those entered by the previous Request participant.

![&quot;Data&quot; tab displays editable values for a completed Task](../../.gitbook/assets/data-tab-completed-task-tasks.png)

Follow these steps to edit and save the values from those entered by a previous Request participant:

1. View the **Data** tab.
2. From the editable JSON field, change the values from those entered by the previous Request participant to those that you want.
3. Click **Save**. The following message displays when the Request values are changed: **Request data successfully updated**.

### Summary

The Task summary displays general information about the assigned Task. The summary displays beside the assigned Task.

If the assigned Task is overdue, the summary's label displays **Overdue**.

![Summary for an assigned Task that is overdue](../../.gitbook/assets/assigned-to-do-summary-active-overdue-tasks.png)

If the assigned Task is not overdue, the summary's label displays **Open**.

![Summary for an assigned Task that is not overdue](../../.gitbook/assets/assigned-to-do-summary-active-open-tasks.png)

The following summary displays about an assigned Task:

* **Due:** The **Due** field displays the date and time the assigned Task is due.
* **Assigned To:** The **Assigned To** field displays the avatar and full name of the person assigned the Task.
* **Assigned:** The date and time the Task was assigned displays below the **Assigned To** field. The **Reassign** button displays if the Task can be reassigned. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../profile-settings.md#change-your-processmaker-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Request:** The **Request** field displays the Process name associated with the Request preceded by its numerical iteration. Click the Process name to [view the Request summary](../requests/request-details/).
* **Requested By:** The **Requested By** field displays the avatar and full name of the person who started the Request. Hover your cursor over a user's avatar to view that person's full name.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Reassign a Task

If the Task has been configured to allow the Task assignee to reassign the Task to another ProcessMaker user, the **Reassign** button displays in the Task summary.

If this Task is assigned only to you, unless you started this Request, then no other ProcessMaker users are available to which to reassign this Task.

Follow these steps to reassign a Task to another ProcessMaker user:

1. Click the **Reassign** button. The **Reassign to** screen displays.  

   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/reassign-to-screen-task-summary-tasks.png)

2. Select the user to whom to reassign the Task.
3. Click **Reassign**.

### What Happens if the Task Cannot Be Reassigned?

If the Task has not been configured that it can be reassigned, then the **Reassign** button does not display. Therefore, the Task assignee does not have the option to reassign the Task to another ProcessMaker user.
{% endhint %}

## Summary for a Completed Task

The Task summary displays general information about the completed Task. Follow these steps to view the summary for a completed Task:
