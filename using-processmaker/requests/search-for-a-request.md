# Search for a Request

## Overview

Do [basic](search-for-a-request.md#basic-search-for-a-request) or [advanced](search-for-a-request.md#advanced-search-for-a-request) searches for Requests. To do basic or advanced searches for Requests, view one of the following **Requests** pages:

* **My Requests** page. See [View Your Requests That You Started](view-started-requests.md#view-your-requests).
* **In Progress** page. See [View Requests That Are In Progress](view-in-progress-requests.md#view-in-progress-requests-in-which-you-are-participating).
* **Completed** page. See [View Completed Requests](view-completed-requests.md#view-completed-requests-in-which-you-participated).
* **All Requests** page. See [View All Requests](view-all-requests.md#view-all-requests-in-your-organization). \(Note that your ProcessMaker user account must have the [**Requests: View All Requests** permission](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#requests) to view the **All Requests** page.\)

## Basic Search for a Request

Follow these steps to do a basic search for a Request:

1. View one of the **Requests** pages described in the [Overview](search-for-a-request.md#overview) of this topic.
2. Ensure that the basic search settings are displaying on the **Requests** page you are viewing.

   If not, then click the **Basic Search** button![](../../.gitbook/assets/basic-search-button.gif).

3. Use Request data to search for Requests based on the following criteria:
   * **Process:** From the **Process** field, select one or more Process names associated with a Request as part of the search criteria. Type into the **Process** setting to filter Processes that display in that setting's drop-down menu. To remove a Process that is currently selected, click the![](../../.gitbook/assets/remove-group-user-admin.png)icon for that selection or click `Enter` when the drop-down is visible.
   * **Status:** From the **Status** setting, select one or more Request statuses as part of the search criteria. Type into the **Status** setting to filter statuses that display in that setting's drop-down menu. To remove a status that is currently selected, click the![](../../.gitbook/assets/remove-group-user-admin.png)icon for that selection or click `Enter` when the drop-down is visible.

     Search using one or more of the following Request statuses:

     * **In progress:** Include Requests that are in progress as part of your search criteria. Requests that are in progress are included by default when searching for Requests on the **In Progress** page.
     * **Completed:** Include Requests that are completed as part of your search criteria. Requests that are completed are included by default when searching for Requests on the **Completed** page.
     * **Error:** Include Requests that are in error as part of your search criteria.
     * **Canceled:** Include Requests that have been canceled as part of your search criteria.

   * **Requester:** From the **Requester** setting, select one or more Requesters as part of your search criteria. A Requester is a ProcessMaker user who starts a Request. The currently logged on ProcessMaker user is included by default when searching for Requests on the **My Requests** page. Type into the **Requester** setting to filter requesters that display in that setting's drop-down menu. To remove a Requester that is currently selected, click the![](../../.gitbook/assets/remove-group-user-admin.png)icon for that selection or click `Enter` when the drop-down is visible.
   * **Participants:** From the **Participants** setting, select one or more Request participants as part of your search criteria. Type into the **Participants** setting to filter Request participants that display in that setting's drop-down menu. To remove a Request participant that is currently selected, click the![](../../.gitbook/assets/remove-group-user-admin.png)icon for that selection or click `Enter` when the drop-down is visible.
4. Click the **Search** button![](../../.gitbook/assets/request-task-search-button.png)to search for Requests based on your entered criteria.
5. Optionally, if the [Save Searches package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) is installed in your ProcessMaker instance, save and share the Request search by clicking the **Save Search** button![](../../.gitbook/assets/save-search-button-requests-tasks.png). See [Save and Share Request- and Task-Related Searches](../save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/).

## Advanced Search for a Request

Use the ProcessMaker Query Language \(PMQL\) to compose an advanced search for Requests.

{% hint style="info" %}
Basic Request searches also use PMQL, but basic searches provide a user interface. Configure a basic search, and then click the Advanced Search button![](../../.gitbook/assets/advanced-search-button.png)to see the PMQL. This may help you learn how to use PMQL.
{% endhint %}

Follow these guidelines to do an advanced search for a Request using PMQL:

1. View one of the **Requests** pages described in the [Overview](search-for-a-request.md#overview) of this topic.
2. Ensure that the advanced search setting is displaying on the **Requests** page you are viewing.  

   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/advanced-request-search-requests.png)

   If not, then click the **Advanced Search** button![](../../.gitbook/assets/advanced-search-button.png).

3. In the **PMQL** setting, enter your PMQL parameters that compose your advanced search. See [PMQL Syntax for Requests](../search-processmaker-data-using-pmql/#pmql-syntax-for-requests).

   Below is an example of a valid advanced Request search:

   `(request = "Process Name 1" OR request = "Process Name 2") AND (status = "Canceled" OR status = "Error") AND (requester = "Username1" OR requester = "Username2") AND (participant = "Username3" OR participant = "Username4" AND (data.last_name= "Canera") AND (updated_at < NOW -2 day)`

4. Click the **Search** button![](../../.gitbook/assets/request-task-search-button.png)to search for Requests based on your entered criteria. If there is no search criteria in the **PMQL** setting when the **Search** button is clicked, the following message displays: **Search query is empty. Please add search attributes or PMQL before saving.**
5. Optionally, if the [Save Searches package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) is installed in your ProcessMaker instance, save and share the Request search by clicking the **Save Search** button![](../../.gitbook/assets/save-search-button-requests-tasks.png). See [Save and Share Request- and Task-Related Searches](../save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/).
